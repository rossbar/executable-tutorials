# Executable Tutorials

This is meant to demonstrate by example how to deploy tutorial materials. The
examples show common patterns including runnable code, plots, exercises with
solutions, etc.

## How to Run The Code

`````{tab-set}
````{tab-item} Locally with pixi

Clone the repository and launch JupyterLab.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/scientific-python/executable-tutorials
cd executable-tutorials

pixi run start
```
````

````{tab-item} Locally with pip

Clone the repository, create an enviornment, install the requirements, and
launch JupyterLab.


```sh
git clone https://github.com/scientific-python/executable-tutorials
cd executable-tutorials

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter lab
```

## Contributing documentation

We maintain guideline documents for maintainers of tutorial repositories in our [Maintainers' Guide](./maintainer-guide.md).
We envision this document to be a collection of collective wisdom about maintaining MyST Markdown based executable tutorials.

We also have a document for contributors of this repository in our [Contributors' Guide](./contributing.md).
